This directory contains a variant of the problem-independent BSF-skeleton files with the BSF prefix that do not use MPI. They can be used together with the problem-dependent files <<Problem-*.*>> for the initial implementation and debugging of the algorithm in MS Visual Studio. In this case, it is assumed that MPI_Comm_size=2. This corresponds to a configuration with one master and one worker. After the program is debugged, the specified files << BSF -*.*>> are replaced with the files of the same name from the parent directory, and the program can be compiled and run without any other changes in an environment that supports MPI.
